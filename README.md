# Kylon

**"Building Unbreakable Foundations for K8s Data."**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Kylon is an ambitious, open-source project aimed at developing an intelligent and highly reliable Kubernetes backup and recovery solution. Built from scratch with a robust **Golang** backend and a modern **Next.js** frontend, Kylon seeks to provide granular control, superior performance, and cutting-edge **AI-driven insights** for ensuring the continuity and integrity of your cloud-native applications across **multiple Kubernetes clusters** and **diverse cloud environments**.

Unlike generic backup tools, Kylon is designed for deep Kubernetes integration, offering precise control over both stateless configurations and critical stateful data. It moves towards proactive data management through artificial intelligence, ensuring your applications are resilient across multi-cluster and multi-cloud architectures.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned & In Progress)

* **Multi-Cluster Support:**
    * Seamlessly manage, backup, and restore data across multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single Kylon instance.
    * Secure registration and storage of `kubeconfig` for various clusters.
    * Scoped operations allowing targeted backups and restores per cluster.
* **Multi-Cloud & Object Storage Agnostic:**
    * Native integration with popular object storage providers across different cloud platforms (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and S3-compatible endpoints).
    * Flexibly store and retrieve backups regardless of your underlying cloud infrastructure.
* **Custom Kubernetes Backup:**
    * Comprehensive backup of stateless Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, CRDs, etc.).
    * Robust backup of stateful applications leveraging CSI Volume Snapshots for Persistent Volumes.
    * Application-level consistent backups for databases (via `kubectl exec` and dump tools).
* **Golang Powered Backend:**
    * High-performance, concurrent backend for interacting with Kubernetes API and managing backup operations.
    * Robust scheduling engine for automated backup policies.
* **Modern Next.js Frontend:**
    * Intuitive and responsive dashboard for managing backups, restores, and configurations across all clusters and clouds.
    * Real-time status updates and detailed logging for operations.
    * User-friendly interfaces for defining backup policies and retention.
* **AI-Driven Intelligence (Future Enhancement):**
    * **Predictive Anomaly Detection:** Anticipate potential backup failures or resource issues based on historical data and cluster metrics.
    * **Intelligent Resource Selection:** Recommend optimal resources for backup/exclusion to minimize size and time.
    * **NLP-Powered Assistant:** Natural language interaction for common backup/restore commands.
    * **Automated Recovery Path Recommendation:** Suggest optimal restore strategies based on failure patterns.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integration hooks for Prometheus/Grafana to monitor backup health and performance.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Kylon follows a clear separation of concerns, designed with multi-cluster and multi-cloud management at its core:

* **Golang Backend:** Serves as the core logic engine. It dynamically manages connections to registered Kubernetes clusters, interacts with their respective Kubernetes APIs (`client-go`), handles storage interactions with various cloud providers, manages scheduling, and will host the AI inference engine. It exposes a clean RESTful API for the frontend.
* **Next.js Frontend:** Provides a rich, interactive user interface. It consumes the REST API from the Golang backend to display dashboards, manage configurations, and trigger operations across all registered clusters and cloud storage locations.
* **Kubernetes Clusters (Targeted):** The environments where your applications and data reside. Kylon interacts with their Kubernetes APIs for resource definitions and orchestrates CSI Volume Snapshots for persistent data.
* **Cloud Object Storage (Multi-Cloud):** External object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, or any S3-compatible service) where backed-up resource definitions and persistent volume snapshots are stored securely, with a clear organizational structure per cluster and cloud.
* **AI/ML Platform (External/Integrated):** For training complex models (e.g., for anomaly detection), a separate ML platform can be used. Trained models (or their lightweight inference components) will then be integrated into the Golang backend.
